        <b>  The unit circle, or trig circle as it's also known, is useful to know <br> because it lets us easily calculate the cosine, sine, and tangent of <br> any angle between 0° and 360°. In a Unit Circle, the cos value of an <br> angle will be the x value of the coordinate. While the sin value <br> is the y coordinate of the angle. Which means the tan value <br> is the x coordinate divided by the y coordinate.</b> <br>
