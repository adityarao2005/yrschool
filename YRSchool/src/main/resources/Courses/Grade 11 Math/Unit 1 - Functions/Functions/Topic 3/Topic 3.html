	<h2>Topic 3 - Min and Max of a Parabola</h2>


<text> A parabola can be represented in 3 forms: vertex, standard, and factored. <br> Let's use the example of f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>+x-6. <br> This is standard form, and it can be converted to factored form by factoring. <br> f(x) = (x-2)(x+3) is it in factored form, and this is useful because it shows us the roots of the parabola(the values of x that make the function equal to 0). <br> Finally, f(x) = (x+1/2)<sup>2</sup>-6.25 is in vertex form. <br> This is useful because it gives the minimum or maximum of the function. <br>
The form of a parabola in vertex form is f(x) = a(x-h)<sup>2</sup>+k. <br>To determine whether the parabola has a minimum value or a maximum value, we look at the value of a. <br>If the a value is negative, then the parabola is downwards facing and has a maximum value. <br>If it is positive, then the parabola is upwards facing and has a minimum value. <br> The coordinates of this minimum or maximum value are given by (h, k). <br>Be careful when analyzing parabolas, as the general form of a parabola shows -h.
<br><br>
Going back to our example, we can see that the parabola is upwards facing, and therefore has a minimum value. We can also see that the cooridnates of the minimum value are (-0.5, -6.25). <br> An graph of f(x) is shown below: <br>

As can be seen, it is an upwards facing parabola with a minimum at (-0.5, -6.25).
<br>

<p> <b> Practice: </b>
	State whether each parabola is upwards facing or downwards facing, and the coordinates of their minimum or maximum point: <br>
	1. f(x)=-8(x-9)<sup>2</sup> <br>
	2. f(x)=-3(x+1)<sup>2</sup>-99 <br>
	3. f(x)=(x)<sup>2</sup>+6.3 <br>
	4. f(x)=7(x+4)<sup>2</sup>-2 <br>
	5. f(x)=(x-77)<sup>2</sup>+7
