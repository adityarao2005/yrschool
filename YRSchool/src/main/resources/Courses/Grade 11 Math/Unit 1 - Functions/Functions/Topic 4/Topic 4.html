	<h2>Topic 4 - Radicals</h2>


<text> A radical is represented by the symbol &#8730. In this lesson, we will be dicussing when the radical represents a square root. <br>
	The answer to a square root is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number under the square root. <br>For example, &#8730;4 gives 2, because 2*2=4.
	<br> <br>
	When we are multiplying two radicals, eg. &#8730a * &#8730b, we can combine them into 1, as &#8730ab. <br>This means that we can also pull them apart, by doing &#8730ab=&#8730a * &#8730b. <br>This allows us to do simplifications like &#8730;20 = &#8730;4 * &#8730;5 = 2*&#8730;5.

<br>

<p> <b> Practice: </b>
	Simplify the following radicals, and leave the answer in exact form: <br>
	1. &#8730;44 <br>
	2. &#8730;64 * &#8730;4  <br>
	3. &#8730;4 * &#8730;4 <br>
	4. &#8730;25 * &#8730;7 <br>
	5. &#8730;32 * &#8730;9
