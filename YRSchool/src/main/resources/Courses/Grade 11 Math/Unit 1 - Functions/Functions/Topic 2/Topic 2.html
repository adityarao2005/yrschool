	<h2>Topic 2 - Function Notation</h2>


<text> A function f(x) is another way of representing a graph/relation where y = something. <br>
	However, in order for a relation to be a function, it must pass something called the vertical line test. <br> <br>
	For any function, it is needed to guarantee that each value of x corresponds to exactly one value of y. <br>
	In other words, each input can only correspond to one output. <br> <br>

	Example 1: Is f(x)= x<sup>2</sup> a function?
	<br>
	<br>
	In order to determine this, we can graph this function, and see if it passes the vertical line test. <br> The graph of f(x) is shown below. <br/> <br/>

<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p> To do the vertical line test, imagine drawing a straight, vertical line down the graph, at any value of x. <br/>If this line touches multiple parts of the graph, then we can say that the relation fails the vertical line test. <br/>If there is no vertical line that can be drawn that touches multiple parts of the graph, then we say that the relation passes the vertical line function. <br/>In this case, the relation passes the vertical line test. This means that it is a function. </p>

<text> An example of a relation that fails the vertical line test is y<sup>2</sup>=x, the graph of which is shown below. <br><br>
<img src='y^2=x.png' style="width:300px;height:300px;" align="left"/>
<br/> <br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p> As can be seen, a vertical line can be drawn at x=5, that passes through the function at 2 points. <br> This means that this relation is not a function, hence why it was denoted as y<sup>2</sup>=x instead of using function notation.
<p> <b> Practice: </b>
	Determine which of the following are functions: <br>
	1. y=14x<sup>2</sup> <br>
	2. y=1/9x+3 <br>
	3. y=&#8730x+12 <br>
	4. y<sup>2</sup>+x<sup>2</sup>=25 <br>
	5. y=3
