	<h1>Unit 1 - Functions </h1>
	<h2>Topic 1 - Domain and Range</h2>

<b>Definitions: </b> </br>
<br/>  <b>Domain:</b> The set of x values that a function can take  </br>
<p>The 'x' values that a function can be take can be thought of as the 'inputs' to a function. For example, in the function f(x) = 2x, x=5 would be an input, which would give some output value(in this case 10).</p>

<br/><b>Range:</b> The set of y values that a function can output</br>
<p>As the domain of a function f(x) was defined as the set of valid inputs, the range of a function is defined as the set of valid outputs, meaning all of the possible outputs that a function can give. <br/>Using the example for the domain, the input x=5 in f(x)=2x would give an output of 10, which we can say belongs to the range of f(x), as it is a valid output.<p>


<b>Examples: </b> </br>

<br/>Find the domain and range of the function f(x)=&#8730x </br>
<p> To find the domain, we need to determine what values of x are valid. <br> We can see that the x in f(x) is under a square root symbol, meaning that x must be &#8805 0. <br> 
There are no more restrictions on the value of x, so our domain is that x &#8805 0.<p>


<p> We can use this information to determine the range of f(x). To determine the range, we will want to find the smallest possible output of f(x). <br/>In this case, the value x=0 gives the smallest output, giving &#8730;0=0. <br>
We will then need to find the largest possible output of f(x). In this case, there is no definitive max value, because x can keep getting bigger and bigger, and the output from f(x) will get bigger and bigger. <br/>Therefore, our range of output values is only limited by a smallest value. This means that our range is y &#8805 0. <br/> <br/> <br/>

<p> As we can see from an image of the graph of f(x), there are no points where x&#60;0, and there are also no points where y&#60;0.

<p> <b> Practice: </b>
	Find the domain and range of the following functions: <br>
	1. f(x)=x<sup>2</sup> <br>
	2. f(x)=1/x <br>
	3. f(x)=&#8730x+1 <br>
	4. f(x)=9x+7 <br>
	5. f(x)=9
